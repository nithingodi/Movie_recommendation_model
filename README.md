AI Movie Concierge: A Hybrid Content-Based Recommendation System
Live Demo URL: https://movierecommendationmodel-fbx2pzr5digcl6wkpd6det.streamlit.app/

This project demonstrates an end-to-end, cloud-native movie recommendation engine that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized, explainable recommendations. The system is deployed on AWS and features a conversational AI for new user onboarding.

‚ú® Key Features
Hybrid Recommendation Model: Combines user behavior with deep content analysis to provide nuanced recommendations.

AI-Driven User Personas: Uses K-Means clustering to automatically segment users into distinct taste profiles (e.g., "The Suspense Seeker," "The Blockbuster Escapist").

Deep Content Understanding (CV & NLP):

NLP Analysis: Utilizes a SentenceTransformer model to analyze movie synopses and keywords, creating a "thematic DNA" for each film.

Computer Vision Analysis: Employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to analyze trailer thumbnails, creating a "visual DNA" based on cinematography and style.

Explainable AI (XAI): Provides a clear, human-readable reason for each recommendation (e.g., "Recommended because it's similar to 'Inception'").

Conversational Onboarding for New Users: Integrates Amazon Bedrock (using the Titan LLM) to understand natural language prompts from new users and generate "cold start" recommendations.

Cloud-Native & Serverless Deployment: The entire backend is built on AWS, with the core model deployed as a scalable SageMaker Real-Time Endpoint and the frontend hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud.

üöÄ How It Works
The project is divided into two main user journeys:

1. The Returning User Journey (Personalized Recommendations)
For users with an existing viewing history, the system performs the following steps:

User Profile Generation: The user's "taste profile" is calculated as a weighted average of the "DNA" vectors of movies they have previously rated highly. This calculation incorporates Taste Drift by applying a time-decay function to older ratings.

API Call: The Streamlit frontend sends the user_id to the live SageMaker Endpoint.

Matching: The endpoint calculates the cosine similarity between the user's taste vector and the pre-computed "DNA" vectors of a pool of new candidate movies.

Ranking & Explanation: The top 5 movies are returned, along with an explanation generated by finding the movie from the user's history that is most similar to each recommendation.

2. The New User Journey (Conversational "Cold Start")
For new users, the system uses a conversational approach:

User Prompt: The user describes what they want to watch in natural language (e.g., "a thriller like the movie Dark").

LLM Processing: The prompt is sent to Amazon Bedrock. A carefully engineered meta-prompt instructs the LLM to extract the key information into a structured JSON object.

Seed Movie Analysis: The system uses the "seed" movie from the JSON ("Dark") and runs it through the same CV/NLP pipeline to generate its "DNA" vector.

Matching: This single vector is used as a temporary user profile to find the most similar movies from the candidate pool.

üîÆ Future Work
Full Trailer Analysis: Upgrade the CV pipeline from using trailer thumbnails to analyzing multiple keyframes extracted from the full video trailer for a richer visual understanding.

Session-Based Recommendations: Implement a model (like an RNN) to understand a user's short-term mood and intent within a single viewing session.

SageMaker Feature Store: Migrate the pre-computed "movie DNA" vectors to SageMaker Feature Store for lower latency and better feature management in a production environment.
